----------

The best way to contact us is to send a mail to the [Wakame Users Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB#!forum/wakame-ug) on Google Groups. Please don't hesitate to ask us any questions. We realise Wakame-vdc is difficult to set up and that our documentation is very limited at this time. If you want to try it out, we'll do our best to help you. There's no such thing as a stupid question.

If you happen to be in Tokyo, you can also attend one of our Wakame Users Group events. They are open to everybody. Further details on http://wakameusersgroup.org.
